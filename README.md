## FreeskiDb-Server

Just a tiny ASP.NET Core WebApi for hobby purposes.
Uses the [Cosmos  DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) for storage.

### Requirements
- ASP.NET Core 2.2
- Cosmos DB Emulator

In order to run the tests you need the [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) installed and running.

Currently the emulator is only available on Windows. However Microsoft is [working on](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263030-azure-cosmos-db/suggestions/18533509-add-documentdb-emulator-support-for-mac-os-x-and) bringing the emulator to Mac and Linux.
